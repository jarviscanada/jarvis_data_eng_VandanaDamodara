# Introduction

This Java Grep application is designed to implement the usage of grep app in Linux systems. This app allows to search for matching strings from files. There are two approaches to implement this function , First it is created using for and while loops, second one  using lambda and stream APIs.
The project was built with Apache Maven and deployed using docker.This application can be used by anyone who wants to search for specific pattern through a directory of files and return the output  in a particular file.
his app has been implemented using Java interface and required library packages including java.io, java.util, and java.slf4j
All the Exception handlings are properly handled.Java Code is written in intellij IDE with Maven as project management outline.

# Quick Start

This app can be used by following three ways:

##Aproach 1: Using classpath and classfiles

''''java -classpath target/classes ca.jrvs.apps.grep.JavaGrepImp {regex_pattern} ./data /out/grep.txt''''

'''java -classpath target/classes ca.jrvs.apps.grep.JavaGrepLambdaImp {regex_pattern} ./data /out/grep.txt''''

##Aproach 2: Using jarfiles

''''java -cp target/grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ca.jrvs.apps.grep.JavaGrepImp {regex_pattern} ./data /out/grep.txt''''

''''java -cp target/grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ca.jrvs.apps.grep.JavaGrepLambdaImp {regex_pattern} ./data /out/grep.txt''''

##Approach 3: Using Docker container

''''docker run --rm -v `pwd`/data:/data -v `pwd`/log:/log ${docker_user}/grep {regex_pattern} /data /log/grep.out''''

#Implemenation
## Pseudocode

''''matchedLines = []
for file in listFilesRecursively(rootDir)
for line in readLines(file)
if containsPattern(line)
matchedLines.add(line)
writeToFile(matchedLines)'''''

## Performance Issue

The functionality of this Grep app requires to handle huge data to be stored in its memory for further recursively searched 
This requires a huge amount of memory since the task involves JVM parsing all the text input and storing it for search. It is possible to specify the amount of heap memory JVM uses. If this memory is not enough to run the JVM, OutOfMemoryError exception occurs.
This exception can be handled by by increasing the amount of memory assigned to the JVM by using the following command.

''''java -Xms5m -Xmx5m -cp target/grep-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ca.jrvs.apps.grep.JavaGrepImp .*Romeo.*Juliet.* ./data ./out/grep.txt''''

where Xms specifies minimum heap size and Xmx specifies maximum heap size .To increase Heap size memory change the value of maximum size of memory in the given command.

# Test

This app is manually tested by comparing the output of the Linux grep command with the ones generated by the app.It is also tested in Intellij IDE by providing the Sample Text dats as source file and Storing the output in out file.

# Deployment

The Java Grep Application was converted into an image using docker build and uploaded to DockerHub using docker push for easier distribution to users.

# Improvement
 
- When there are multiple files through which we are searching the pattern Data then it would be more efficient to Add more source file information in the output file.

- The size of the input file is limited by the heap size of the machine running the program. Using ,Lambda/Steam implementation will be a solution in this case as this would allow only the data that is being operated on to be held in memory.
