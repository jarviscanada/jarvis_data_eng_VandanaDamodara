    description:  Developed Cluster Monitoring agent  which is used to monitor and collect data of various host machines connected through a network. The data that is collected includes hardware specifications, activity, and performances of machines in the cluster.Data is stored in PostgreSQL Database which is an RDBMS database using Docker Containers.Bash Scripts are used to initialize the process by creating psql container using Docker.Bash scripts are also used to monitor the host usage and host information data. This system uses crontab to collect real-time data every minute to generate statistics regarding resource utilization.The Monitoring agent sends the data to a database for storage and further analysis.
