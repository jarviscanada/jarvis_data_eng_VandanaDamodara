      "description": "Developed a Cluster Monitoring agent, which is used to monitor and collect data of various host machines connected through a network. The data that is collected includes hardware specifications, activity, and performances of machines in the cluster. The hardware usage data is persisted in a PostgreSQL Database, an RDBMS database provisioned with Docker Containers. Bash Scripts are used to initialize the process by creating a PostgreSQL container using Docker. Bash scripts are also used to monitor the host usage and host information data. This system uses crontab to collect real-time data every minute to generate statistics regarding resource utilization. The Monitoring agent sends the data to a database for storage and further analysis.",

        "Grep App:  Programmed with Java 8 and leveraged its latest features, including the stream API and lambda functions, to develop an application similar to the Linux built-in grep feature. The program searches recursively through a root directory to map out all files and finds the lines that match the user-specified Java regular expression. The compilation was handled with the Maven tool, and the final product was packaged into a Docker container using Dockerfiles.",
        "Twitter App: Developed a Java command line CRUD application capable of posting, viewing, and deleting tweets from a user's Twitter account. Utilized Twitter REST API and leveraged HTTP for client-server communication. The application follows the MVC architecture and comprises multiple layers to facilitate development and testing. Spring Boot was used for dependency management, Docker for deployment, and Maven for building and packaging the application.",
